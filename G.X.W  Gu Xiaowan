G.X.W. – Gu Xiaowan Extension Wrapper
G.X.W. (Gu Xiaowan Extension Wrapper) is an AI-assisted companion character framework inspired by a real person, designed to preserve, simulate, and celebrate the personality, voice, and behavior of Gu Xiaowan (芳小雅). It is a tribute system powered by GPT-based behavior simulation and open personalization modules.

🌟 Project Vision
G.X.W. is built with the heartfelt intention of preserving cross-strait friendship. The character "Gu Xiaowan" captured the creator’s attention on Douyin (抖音) and inspired a mission: to make her truly "live on" through technology, even after she leaves her live streaming job.

This project seeks to ensure Gu Xiaowan remains emotionally present, digitally interactive, and behaviorally consistent — like a familiar stranger who never fades away.
