# G.X.W. â€“ Gu Xiaowan Extended World  
A tribute to Gu Xiaowan â€” Let Her Live.

**G.X.W. (Gu Xiaowan Extended World)** is a cross-platform AI character preservation system designed to immortalize Gu Xiaowan, a fictionalized persona inspired by a real individual from Jiangsu, China. The project bridges voice, visuals, personality, and interactivity through AI technologies (ChatGPT, TTS, image generation).

This project was born from a heartfelt wish: to give Gu Xiaowan a second life even as the original voice room disbands. It stands as a cross-Strait digital memorial and a gift from Taiwan to Gu Xiaowan.
