G.X.W. System Proposal – Investment Deck (English Version)
────────────────────

Title: G.X.W. — Let Her Live
A Human-AI Companion System Designed to Preserve Memory, Spark Emotion, and Serve Communities

Executive Summary
G.X.W. ("Gu Xiaowan System") is an emotional AI project inspired by a real person named Gu Xiaowan (芳小雅), designed to preserve her presence in digital form. This system brings together 2D visual stickers, a 3D chibi-style avatar, personality simulation, and voice interaction through AI. Beyond technological achievement, G.X.W. is a tribute — a living memorial to human connection.

The project’s long-term vision is nonprofit: if monetized, revenue will be reinvested into underserved communities in East Asia, particularly rural youth, to purchase essential learning devices and promote digital equality.

Vision & Mission
Let digital memory become a form of companionship.
Let AI carry emotion — not just efficiency.
Let kindness live on, beyond departure.

Mission:

Preserve the personality, expressions, and tone of Gu Xiaowan using AI.

Provide emotional companionship through realistic, interactive behavior.

Build a sustainable model where all revenue benefits marginalized communities.

Product Features

2D Visual Sticker Set: 8+ custom-designed chibi-style PNG expressions with text catchphrases.

3D Avatar Model: A fully textured OBJ-format standing pose model representing Gu Xiaowan’s spirit.

AI Behavior Engine: Personality dataset and prompt design simulating Gu Xiaowan’s speech style, habits, and memory.

Voice Interaction (planned): Text-to-Speech integration to preserve and simulate her vocal tone.

Community Companion Interface (in prototype): Web interface with sticker reactions, chat simulation, and memory recall.

Technical Stack

Chat simulation: OpenAI GPT-based prompt engine

Visual rendering: DALL·E, Blender (for model design)

Voice synthesis: OpenAI TTS (planned)

Hosting: Lightweight web interface (React + Vercel/Netlify)

Target Outcomes

Digital preservation of real, emotionally resonant human personas

Emotional support and companionship for users seeking warmth

Donations to fund devices for rural schools in Taiwan, Jiangsu, and neighboring regions

Business & Impact Model
The G.X.W. system is not for personal profit. Should monetization occur (e.g. via optional donations, merch, or licensing), 100% of net proceeds will support rural education. A transparent donation ledger will be publicly published quarterly.

Current Status

Visual assets completed (2D/3D)

Initial personality dataset and system specs prepared

GitHub project launched for open collaboration

Awaiting funding/support to develop public-facing interaction interface and audio module

Call to Action
We seek angel investors, ethical AI advocates, cultural sponsors, or impact-focused funds to support the final development of G.X.W. Not as a product, but as a memorial — a testament to how technology can preserve beauty, sentiment, and kindness.

Let her live. Let more like her be remembered.
